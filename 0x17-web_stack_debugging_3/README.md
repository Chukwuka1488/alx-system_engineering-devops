### Web stack debugging #3
Sure, I can guide you through the process of using `strace` to debug an Apache server returning a 500 error, and then automating the fix using Puppet.

**Step 1: Debugging with strace**

First, you need to find the process ID of the Apache server. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
ps aux | grep apache2
```

Once you have the process ID, you can attach `strace` to it:

```bash
strace -p [process_id]
```

Replace `[process_id]` with the actual process ID of the Apache server.

Now, in another terminal window, you can make a request to the server:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost
```

Back in the `strace` terminal, you should see a lot of output. Look for any errors or unusual behavior that could be causing the 500 error.

**Step 2: Fixing the Issue**

The fix will depend on what you find in the `strace` output. For example, if there's a problem with a configuration file, you might need to edit that file.

**Step 3: Automating the Fix with Puppet**

Once you've manually fixed the issue, you can automate the fix using Puppet. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```puppet
exec { 'fix-apache':
  command => '/usr/bin/fix-apache-script',
  path    => ['/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin'],
}
```

In this example, `/usr/bin/fix-apache-script` is a script that implements the fix. You would replace this with the actual path to your script.
